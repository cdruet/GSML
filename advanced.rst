Advanced Grammar
****************

Explicitly  writing  all  equations  may seem  exciting  to  some  but
exhausting for the vast majority. To circumvent this, the base grammar
is complemented with a more sophisticated one to shorten modelling.

In the sequel, all the  sophisticated mechanism will be introduced and
translated into basic grammar.

The  following features  have already  been identified  as potentially
useful to facilitate the creation of models.

Units
=====

Making units explicit to make it easier to define and understand models and avoid the need for converting everything of the same kind in the same units.

Variables as structures
=======================

Enabling structured variables to increase readability.

Classes
=======

Ability to instantiate and parametrize nodes. E.g. to declare a CCGT class and declare several CCGTs in a system.

Clusters
========

Ability to instantiate and parametrize cluster of nodes. E.g. to declare a country cluster and declare several countries

Sum, Max, Min, Average...
=========================

Ability to use more complex operators. Requires vector variables.
