Granularity (in terms of nodes)
===============================

This section will be about the options the users has when modelling:
* what should be in a node,
* what can be split into multiple nodes, why to do it or not do it,
* whether to include the 'invest' as part of a node, or not,
* etc,

Choosing the right level of details
===================================

This section will be about the equalities:

* what is worth modelling, what isn't (e.g. ramp-up rate)
* the consequences (keep it linear or not),

Explicitly modelling cash flows
===============================

This section will be about:

* using a cost approach, i.e. keeping price implicit and minisising the costs of inputs (of origin nodes, i.e. those without input)
* explicit prices, which enables modelling markup, imperfect competition, etc
