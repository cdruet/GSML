The purpose of GSML
===================

The purpose of GSML is to  facilitate the modelling of systems whether
simple  simulations  or  complex  optimizations  for  further  use  in
simulation and optimisation tools.  GSML enables the users to focus on
modelling systems without the burden  of identifying the most adequate
optimisation  method   and  implementing  it.   It   enables  defining
businesses with  the adequate level  of details  not only in  terms of
technical parameters but also in  financial terms.  The user can focus
on describing, on  the one hand, the relationships  between inputs and
outputs  of all  the  processes and  on the  other  hand, among  their
counterparts,  the  cash  flows  resulting  from  costs  and  revenues
associated with  these processes. The  level of details  is adequately
chosen by the user depending on what she or he wants to analyse.

Let us  look at a not-so-simple example.

In  the   GSML  approach,  businesses/processes  are   represented  as
**nodes**  of a  directed graph.   These nodes  are connected  to each
other through **edges**.  The term *process*  is taken in a very broad
sense of  the word.  A process can  as well be  a physical  process by
which inputs are transformed into outputs  as a more abstract one such
as exchanges where goods are traded.
